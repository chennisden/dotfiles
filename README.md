# Dennis Chen's Arch Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles I use to setup Arch. I used to use Ubuntu but finally got around to installing Arch. So now I can say

    I use arch btw.

I am a beginner. I do not really know what I am doing. These are public in the hopes that they will be useful to other people, but word of warning: it is incredibly likely I screw up in a myriad of ways. Since my dotfiles are personal, there is absolutely no guarantee of stability.

## Install

You will need git installed to do this. These dotfiles use `dotbot`.

To install, clone the repository **in the home directory** by running

	git clone https://github.com/chennisden/dotfiles.git

then navigate inside the repository by running

	cd dotfiles

Run

	./install

to bootstrap the dotfiles.

## What's here?

I use
- Arch Linux as distro
- i3 as window manager
- flameshot to take screenshots
- Zsh as shell
- Vim as editor (for TeX)
- VSCode as IDE (for React JS + larger TeX projects)
- TeX Live (from pacman)
