# Dennis Chen's Ubuntu Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles I use to install Ubuntu. Dotfiles are organized into directories based on function.

I am a beginner. I do not really know what I am doing. These are public in the hopes that they will be useful to other people, but word of warning: it is incredibly likely I screw up in a myriad of ways. Since my dotfiles are personal, there is absolutely no guarantee of stability.

## Install

To install, clone the repository by running

	git clone https://github.com/chennisden/dotfiles.git

then navigate inside the repository by running

	cd dotfiles

and then run

	install/master

It is likely that you will need to restart for these changes to fully take effect.

## What's here?

I use
- Ubuntu as distro
- Zsh as shell
- Vim as editor (for TeX)
- VSCode as IDE (for React JS)
- "Vanilla" TeX Live as TeX distribution
